        <h1> Brealin Redecker's Biography </h1>
        <p>
        My name is Brealin Redecker. I am a senior in the iSchool studying <strong>Information Management and Technology 
        with a concentration in Data Analytics. </strong> I transferred to Syracuse because I 
        knew that I would get a good education and career opportunities.
        </p>
        <p> 
        I aspire to become a database developer, data analyst, or a project manager. I have proficiency 
        in database modeling, SQL programming, and performance tuning. I was a TA for 
        the iSchool’s class IST359 Introduction to Database Management Systems last semester 
        where I was able to further my professional growth.

        <h2> Personal Info </h2>
        <p> 
        I play for the Syracuse Women’s Rugby Team and would like to play professionally one day. One fun fact about me is that I have dual citizenship in America and 
        Ireland and spent half my life living outside of the United States.
