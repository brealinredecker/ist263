        <h2> Who Are We? </h2>
        <p> 
            SUWRFC was founded in the spring of 1997 by two Syracuse University students with no jerseys, coach, or formal training. The team faced challenges, winning only two games in their first two seasons. Undeterred, they secured a coaching staff and set ambitious goals for their future.
                <br>
            Over the next 20 years, SUWRFC achieved remarkable success, capturing Conference Championships, NRU Championships, and D1 State Championships. The team has produced several USA Eagles and Womenâ€™s Premier League players, and established a robust alumni association of hundreds of women who continue to support current and former SU students.
                <br>
            Today, SUWRFC is ranked in the top 20 in the nation for National Collegiate Rugby (NCR) D2 15s, the top 10 in NCR D2 7s, and is the reigning Upstate New York Collegiate Rugby Conference champions.
                <br>
            Our fall season runs from August to November, while our spring season extends from February to April. We remain committed to upholding SUWRFC traditions by playing for each other and honoring those who came before us.
