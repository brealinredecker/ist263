    <body>
    I am a senior in the iSchool studying Information Management and Technology 
    with a concentration in Data Analytics. I transferred to Syracuse because I 
    knew that I would get a good education and career opportunities. I aspire to 
    become a database developer, data analyst, or a project manager. I have proficiency 
    in database modeling, SQL programming, and performance tuning. I was a TA for 
    the iSchool’s class IST359 Introduction to Database Management Systems last semester 
    where I was able to further my professional growth. I play for the Syracuse Women’s 
    Rugby Team and would like to play professionally one day.  I like to DJ and snowboard 
    in my free time. One fun fact about me is that I have dual citizenship in America and 
    Ireland and spent half my life living outside of the United States.
